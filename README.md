Yo sup?,

What the heck is this (you ask)?

tldr; Just managing my entire system through a set of configuration files governed by the nix programming language and the nix ecosystem.

Honestly i'm still learning about this stuff so can't tell much about anything so get out of here.

ToDo:
1) Ricing plans
2) Understand wtf is going on this config files even though i made them i'm still confused mostly about the language
